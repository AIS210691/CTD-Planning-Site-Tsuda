<p> Since I personally like looking up other people's artworks, share the ideas of how to improve, and share the ideas of what to create for specific topics, I want to create a website that allows to do those.</p>

<h3>
<a id="Possible ideas" class="anchor" href="#Possible ideas" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>List of possible ideas</h3>

<p><ol>
<li> photo/picture sharing website </li>
<li> informational website </li>
<li> Business website </li>
<li> E-commerce page design </li>
<li> Design community website layout </li>
<li> Italian restaurant style tile </li>

</p>

<h3>
<a id="Types of sites" class="anchor" href="#Types of sites" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Types of sites</h3>

<a id="Brief" class="anchor" href="#Brief" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Brief</h3>

<p> A new artworks sharing site wanted to gather more attentions and get more users to get an account for free. I want to keep the website decoration as simple as possible but I also wanted to be attractive to the visitors that make them willing to create an account and always trying to keep in touch with it. Since every single person has their own style, I want the back ground picture to be changeble, but I want the main color of this website to be something light and soft. Just like other social media, there is a bar on top of the website with the main color, but I want it to be changable to show the audience how free they can be and how creative they can be in this website. And last but not least, I want them to enjoy the interaction with the animation that they can play with just by clicking the menue selections.
